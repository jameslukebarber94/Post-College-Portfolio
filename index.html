              <p class="card-text text-center" style=""><b>Travers Brothership Rocks Boone with New Music&nbsp;</b><br>by James Luke Barber<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;When the Travers Brothership begins to play, the crowd begins to move. The soul, funk and rock n’ roll ensemble, made up of Eric Travers (Drums, Vocals), Kyle Travers (Guitar, Keys, Vocals), Ian McIsaac (Keys, Percussion), and Josh Clark (Bass, Vocals) are an amalgamation styles and talent, like Billy Preston, John Bonham and Rick James all had a baby.<br><br>Travers Brothership have become somewhat of a cultural staple in Boone. They have a consistent fanbase who come out to their shows. They are a mix of young and old alike, made up people who grew up listening to the classics: The Grateful Dead, James Brown, B.B. King, the Allman Brothers, Jefferson Starship and others.&nbsp;<br><br>Their live shows are full of energy. Kyle Travers and Ian McIsaac change instruments mid song and Josh Clark wails like a southern soul singer. The crowd gets into, flailing their limbs and toe tapping over spilt beer. It works because it’s organic, familiar but different and since its different they call it what they call everything outside the mainstream: alternative.&nbsp;<br><br>The band contribute their edge to the scene they came out of in Asheville years ago.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s competitive out there,” Kyle Travers said. “There has been resurgence of talent in the past couple of years and it really makes you to bring it every night.”&nbsp;<br><br>Brothers Eric and Kyle Travers, as well as McIsaac and Clark, grew up in the Swoannanoa and Black Mountain area. They went to the same schools and grew up playing music. When they started the band, they began touring regionally and playing festivals right off the bat.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, the band is gearing up to release their, as of yet unnamed, sophomore studio effort and preparing for their first international tour in Europe from January to February early next year. Need less to say, the band is on an upswing in their careers, a moment that affirms all of the handwork and energy they have put into their sound and their eagerly anticipated gigs.&nbsp;<br><br>“It feels like everyone has been holding their breath for five years and we’re finally able to breath. The goal all along has simply been to create great music and prove that you’re able to make a living with these guys,” Klye Travers said.<br><br>As for the new music, it is currently being finished up at Echo Mountain studios in Asheville. The tentative date for its release is late summer, early fall. However, the best way to get a glimpse of the new material, is to catch the band on the road.&nbsp;<br><br>“We have already begun including the new songs in our setlist in preparation for summer festival dates at Mountain Music, Floyd Fest and Long Creek,” Eric Travers said.&nbsp;<br><br>At a glance, the new material expands on the sound of the band’s debut effort “A Way to Survive.” The songs sort of blend together, possessing the same soulful and electric elements the band’s fans have come to expect. Yet there is a more mature songwriting aspect to them that still retains its spontaneity. After all, the Brothership has always been known as a jam band. And as any musician knows, jamming in front of an audience is like capturing lightning in a bottle. Only they’ve become more capable of capturing this element in their songwriting and releasing into the crowd.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, it is not all relentless rock n’ roll. There is a real depth here and it is best encompassed in one song “Hold My Name”, written by the band’s bassist, and Appalachian State graduate, Josh Clark. The song is powerful and there is a rawness about it that only Clark could get across.&nbsp;<br><br>“It’s one of those songs that I wrote while in turmoil and at the end of a relationship. I believe it was one of the first songs I wrote for the band and we just started closing our shows with it. The audience really seems to connect with the it,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>The song is just part of the tradition the band has established in Boone and one they are carrying all over the country. Throughout their career they have toured with the likes of Charles Bradley, Taj Mahal, Kyle Hollingsworth Band, Blues Traveler, , Robert Randolph, Leftover Salmon, Trombone Shorty, The Marcus King Band, Dr. John and many others.&nbsp;<br><br>The experience on the road has helped the quartet transform the band from an imitation of their influences into something unique and people are taking notice. The road ahead is full of potential as the band continues to venture forward.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re constantly setting new expectations,” Kyle Travers said. “I can’t say I expected to be where we’re at today, so we’re always adjusting and just getting to the point where we can go anywhere in the country and accrue a decent following. We’re not pop stars. We just play great music.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center"><b>A Lecture with Scholar C.R. Browning&nbsp;<br></b>by: James Luke Barber&nbsp;<br><br>The annual North Carolina Jewish Studies Consortium was at held at Appalachian State on Sunday, September 25 and featured author and scholar, Christopher R. Browning.&nbsp;<br><br>The Consortium provides a forum for professors and researchers from across North Carolina to meet with other intellectuals, network and to advance ideas concerning Jewish history.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;“This meeting takes place all over the state,” said Dr. Thomas Kaplan, professor of history at the Center of Judaic, Holocaust and Peace Studies. “But this is the first time it's been held in Boone. Professor Browning, who is one of the leading Holocaust historians in the world, is part of a shift that we are taking to provide students with more research opportunities and access to scholars.&nbsp;<br><br>Browning is known for his critically acclaimed work “Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101” and many other works that could make up a small library on Holocaust studies. Browning currently teaches at UNC Chapel Hill and has been responsible for the preservation of numerous personal accounts of many survivors.<br><br>&nbsp; “In the 80s and 90s there was concerted effort to collect testimonies. However, over time these stories become blander, sanitized, more black and white, and less gray,” Browning said during his lecture. “People become confused, and they incorporate what they see in movies, novels and documentaries into their personal stories. As the consensus among this special community grows, the reflection departs from the reality.”<br><br>&nbsp; The importance of these accounts only grows over time. Today, few WWII veterans survive, and even fewer are the number of those who endured the Holocaust. The most prominent of which, Elie Wiesel, author of his own, haunting personal account, entitled “Night”, passed away in July of this year.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, survivors are those who lived through the Holocaust as infants or toddlers. Such as one woman, who Prof. Kaplan explained, was smuggled to a Polish family as infant. Her parents endured the internment camps and they were miraculously reunited after the war. The beauty in these experiences is not lost, but are told in third person through the survivors themselves.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;“One popular misconception [often portrayed in movies like “Schindler’s List] is that there was a selection off the train at Auschwitz (women and children were separated from the men and immediately sent to the gas chamber). The fact is there were child survivors at Auschwitz,” Browning said. “If the popular narrative were actually true, then many people would not be alive today.&nbsp;<br><br>Out of 42,000 internment camps spread out across Nazi controlled Europe, 30,000 of these were work camps. The rest were death camps. Skilled Jewish workers could purchase work permits which was, as Browning puts it, “essentially selling yourself into slavery.” Many German companies enlisted this forced labor in order to produce food, clothing, bombs, ammunition and anything else to aid the war effort. Many German fortune 500 companies can have their roots traced back to these factories. Even the V2 rocket, a technological predecessor to the Apollo 11 rocket that landed humans on the moon, was built in these work camps that employed slave labor.&nbsp;<br><br>“Jews could go into the these camps as families,” Browning said. “They even had protection against the typhus outbreak at the time. Owners initially killed those with the typhus, but once they learned that keeping the sick alive could improve their bottom line, they started healing their workers.”&nbsp;<br><br>“The culture within these camps created a flourishing black market. Everything was for sale, even the guards. Well-to-do Jewish families, especially ones who owned property back in Poland, could bribe the guards to bring in resources such as food, water, work and medicine.” “The narrative that survivors provide is often not one of redemption,” Browning said.&nbsp;<br><br>The lecture convened and Browning took questions from the crowd, one of which centered around immigration.&nbsp;<br><br>“While the US government did take in some Jewish refugees before the war, there were still concerns as to how these people would mix into the population, and this was coming from inside the government as well as the public. The US wanted to conserve its demographic, that being white anglo-saxon protestant Christians, and they were afraid that some refugees could be Nazi spies. If one bad apple got through, then national security would compromised, or so they thought.”&nbsp;<br><br>The rhetoric today sounds eerily familiar, nevertheless it reinforces the idea that history is prone to repeat itself. Today, many refugees from the Middle East seek safety in Western countries. The good and bad of humanity are represented in these populations, but it is up to the public to decide which one negates the other. Afterall, Albert Einstein was a refugee himself.<br><br>&nbsp; “I am privileged by fate to live here in Princeton . . . . In this small university town the chaotic voices of human strife barely penetrate. I am almost ashamed to be living in such peace while all the rest struggle and suffer.” —Einstein, 1933.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center"><b>Boone, N.C.’s Clean Energy Reality&nbsp;<br></b>by: James Luke Barber&nbsp;<br><br>The energy industry in North Carolina is not easy to change. Fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas remain the leading energy sources on which the economy runs. The power to switch to renewables like solar and wind, lies in the hands of the state legislature, as well as Duke Ener- gy, the largest energy company in the world.&nbsp;<br><br>The town of Boone, North Carolina, and the area around it, have the potential to stand at the forefront of clean energy development within the state. The energy needs of the community are not supplied by Duke Energy, but rather by smaller energy co-ops such as Blue Ridge Elec- tric and New River Electric. These local energy suppliers coupled with students and teachers from Appalachians State’s sustainable technology program, give evidence that the area is moving forward to a more sustainable future. However, the progress is currently on the intellectual front.<br><br>&nbsp;“The key, I believe,” said Boone Mayor Rennie Brantz, “is to create a mindset of sustain- ability.”&nbsp;<br><br>The city council has already installed electric car charging stations, low beam street lamps, and a new metering system to make home water usage more efficient. In December of 2016, the town passed a resolution, co-authored by App State anthropology professor Harvard Ayers, calling for the state and the rest of the country to switch to 100 percent clean energy by the year 2050.&nbsp;<br><br>While one of the first of its kind in the US, the resolution does not require any specific action on behalf of the town itself. Which begs the question: is switching to 100 percent renew- able energy realistic? ￼<br><br>“It may be impossible,” says Appalachian State sustainable technology professor George Devine.&nbsp;<br><br>The potential for efficient renewable usage depends on an area’s geographic location. An area such as Boone, for example, cannot allocate too much of its energy portfolio on solar, since the sun only shines, on average, for five hours a day. Others sources like geothermal, require steam that comes off of hot pools of water miles below the Earth’s surface. Finding these spots would require a seismic study.&nbsp;<br><br>According to professor Devine, “out of all our resources, wind power remains the most promising for the region,” he said. However, Boone’s history with clean energy projects has not always been pretty. In 1979, NASA funded a project to erect the world’s tallest windmill atop Howard’s Knob. It was a prototype, meant to test the structural design to be applied and im- proved upon for future models. The public, however, found it a nuisance. For years residents complained that it was too noisy, and—worst of all—it interrupted TV signals. In the late 80s the project ended.The turbine was sold for parts and later dismantled.&nbsp;<br><br>Fortunately, the technology for capturing the wind’s energy has improved exponentially since the late 70s, and ASU’s windmill stands as a lone promise as to what the area could poten- tially behold. However, to build more of these wind turbines would require an exception to the Ridge Law, which bans structures taller that 50 feet on peaks higher than 3,000 feet in elevation.&nbsp;<br><br>“Ideally, you would want these turbines on top of these peaks to capture as much wind as possible,” said Professor Devine. “But they could take away from the quaintness of the view, which tourists come here to enjoy. What we can do is put up wind turbines of a different type. There are smaller models that are designed vertically and meant to be installed residentially.”<br><br>&nbsp;￼The Ridge Law is not the only thing keeping the town of Boone from building wind or solar farms. To do so anyway, they would have to attract a renewable energy company to move to Boone, the same way in which Lenoir attracted Google to build a data center in its town.&nbsp;<br><br>“There is simply not enough land available within the city limits to build such a project,” Brantz said. In other words, the land that was once available has already been developed, and since Boone resides in a valley, it was sparse to begin with.<br><br>&nbsp;To find the real change that is progressing Appalachia away from fossil fuels, one has to look toward the private sector. Solar, in particular, has driven the clean energy industry in North Carolina more than any other. In fact, N.C. is ranked as the second largest (or third depending on your source) solar energy collector in the country, with California being the first. One company that has aided in this progress is O2 Energies, a Cornelius based solar developer that has built solar farms all across the state, but their first was in Avery County.<br><br>&nbsp;The Avery solar farm produces approximately one megawatt of energy, or enough to power about 300 homes a year. The company works with investors to fund the building of these projects in rural areas, and local farmers provide sheep and cattle to help keep the land main- tained. The energy collected from the solar farms is ultimately sold to Duke Energy for profit.<br><br>&nbsp;“It is important for communities to find concrete things they can do when looking to switch to clean energy. Such as working with utility companies, and offering programs to work with the town,” said Joel Olsen, founder and president of O2 Energies&nbsp;<br><br>The company’s economic model can be done on a smaller scale. Home and small buis- ness owners can sell their energy back to the electric utilities as long as they have the resources to collect it, whether that be through solar, wind or hydroelectric systems. While these kinds of technologies are becoming increasingly cheaper, they still require significant economic invest- ment. The goal of business investing is to eventually receive more, or at least as much, money back as one puts in. Clean energy investing, however, is a bit different. The goal is to not always make money in the long run, but rather to not have to continue spending money in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>“Investors are usually more concerned with economic trends, more so than with envi- ronmental ones,” noted Joel Olsen. The distinction is an important one to make. Fossil fuels are notorious for their negative effects on the environment, but these fuels are so intrinsic to the fab- ric of first world society that people do not always get to choose how their energy is produced. While environmental groups want to develop renewables for more idealogical reasons, however just they may be, there needs to be an effective economic incentive to do so. One that allows people to maintain, or improve, their current standard of living while not breaking the bank.&nbsp;<br><br>Despite the obvious benefits of clean energy—such as community health benefits, envi- ronmental sustainability and a lower cost of living—there will continue to be opposition. At the time of this writing, there is a legal case between Duke Energy and NC Warn, a third party solar panel supplier based out of Durham, that will shape policy on how people gain access to renew- ables. If people can not purchase these resources through independent sellers, then utility com- panies like Duke Energy will only expand its monopoly on the market.&nbsp;<br><br>The town of Boone, and its surrounding counties, retain enough independence in the market to gain a lot from a push toward sustainability, and with a forward thinking university like Appalachian State, there is real potential to create meaningful change . . . and potential, like energy, is everything.</p>

While they are right to expect large, bearded, kilt- wearing men who look like extras out of “Braveheart” brandishing blue face paint, they may be surprised to hear the sound of bagpipes accompanied by rock n’ roll.<br><br>&nbsp;Seven Nations is a band who, over recent years, has consistently rocked out the Highland Games. They are well-traveled, musical vets that possess a strong following and a discography greater in volume than Led Zeppelin and even Metallica.&nbsp;<br><br>Festivalgoers new to the Games had to wait a little longer to find out just who Seven Nations was. On Friday evening, July 8, a torrential rain seemed to come out of nowhere, thus canceling Seven Nations’ set at MacRae Meadows. In the other parts of the world, the storm could have been mistaken for a monsoon. Winds ramped up to 85 miles per hours, flattening tents and blowing away everything not nailed down. The lead singer of Seven Nations, Kirk McLeod, has been in similar situations before.&nbsp;<br><br>“At least three times we were playing shows in the Midwest and a tornado formed nearby. People evacuated to a shelter but returned less than an hour later completely unphased,” the frontman said.&nbsp;<br><br>Kirk knows how rare tornados can be in North Carolina. From the ages of 12 to 15 he would ride down from New York with his dad to attend the summer camp program at the North American Academy of Piping and Drumming in Valle Crucis to learn how to play the bagpipes. Kirk, who’s mother is English and who’s father is Scottish American, developed an appreciation for Celtic music and rock n’ roll groups such as The Cure at a young age.&nbsp;<br><br>One of his first gigs was playing the bagpipes at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. Visitors curious about the instrument would ask him to play something familiar. So he would begin to jam to the tune of “Star Wars” (way before Disney owned the rights to the franchise) and other pop culture melodies. The trick would prove successful.&nbsp;<br><br>He even incorporated it into his act during the early days of Seven Nations, when they first came on the scene in New York. Kirk would stand on the street corner outside of a music venue and play the pipes to attract a crowd. Once the rest of the band started the show he would lead the crowd inside, continuing to play all the way to the stage. ￼￼<br><br>&nbsp;It was around the late 1990s to the early 2000s that the popularity of the band skyrocketed. They signed onto Atlantic Records and began touring extensively. They were booked to play festivals alongside the likes of James Brown, Counting Crows and 311. Scottish- style music was becoming so popular during the era that bands like Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphys, who both incorporate bagpipes into their respective sounds, began popping up years after Seven Nations’ inception.&nbsp;<br><br>Seven Nations was becoming a nationally recognized act. Perhaps it was due to this newfound popularity, or their worldly sound, that in 2002 afforded it the invitation to play at the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City.&nbsp;<br><br>“That was a really important gig for us and a great thing to be a part of,” McLeod said. “It gave us perhaps, worldwide recognition. Even people over in England were talking about us.”&nbsp;<br><br>The success of the band would prove to be astronomical, as one musically inclined astronaut happens to be a fan. Chris Hadfield, the Canadian astronaut who shot his own version of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” on the International Space Station, brought aboard one of Seven Nations’ albums on his trip around Earth’s orbit.&nbsp;<br><br>“I was quite shocked when we learned about it. An interview (with Hadfield) showed up in a press release and our manager brought it to our attention. He was allowed to bring aboard a couple items, including only two albums, and one of them happened to be ours.”&nbsp;<br><br>It is a feat that not many bands can boast about, that one of their own studio creations has been, and may still be, orbiting around the globe at 17,150 miles per hour or about five miles per second. The album was the band’s third, entitled “The Factory.” It has a black and white picture of young man on the front who is covered in soot.<br><br>&nbsp;Recently Kirk has produced his own solo effort aside from his main band. The title of the album is “Kir” and it sets out to further elaborate on the Scottish elements present in Kirk’s musical repertoire.<br><br>&nbsp;“It incorporates Gaelic chants and songs with traditional music,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>The effort encompasses many of the reasons why Seven Nations, and its music, has been able to stick around for so long. This willingness to branch out and innovate creates a unique listening experience that keeps the music new, fresh and far enough from the mainstream to prevent the style from becoming oversaturated. It has set itself up as a defining, independent act whose studio releases are cultured enough to appeal to the entire family but whose live shows are so electric and frenetic that they can sell out shows on St. Patrick’s Day in Las Vegas.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center"><b>Bodyguards and Bystanders: Trump visits Asheville&nbsp;<br></b>by: James Luke Barber&nbsp;<br><br>Outside of the chic restaurants, craft breweries, hookah shops and niche outfitters, the streets of Asheville were lined with political activists, disgruntled Bernie activists and bright-eyed Republicans as Donald Trump and his campaign rolled into town.&nbsp;<br><br>The event began at 6 p.m. but protestors had been gathering around the US Cellular Center all day to voice their dissent against Trump and his supporters. Many of them held signs reading: “Build Bridges, Not Walls” and “Love Trumps Hate”. Despite this so-called ‘affection’, the dramatic, juxtaposed crowd, made many tense.&nbsp;<br><br>“It is as if San Francisco was uprooted and plopped in the middle of Alabama,” said Preston Heavner, a Warren Wilson student.&nbsp;<br><br>Around 7 p.m. Trump entered into a roaring applause, and he immediately capitalized on Hillary Clinton’s supposed blunder the day before. “While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hard working American patriots who want a better country,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>Clinton had stated one could put half of his supporters, the “racists, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, islamaphobic,” into a “basket of deplorables.” This whipped up crowd up into a great frenzy, and from then on every overall-clad farmer, bright-eyed billy, and buttoned-down conservative hung on to every word.<br><br>&nbsp;They whooped and cheered at every aside to Clinton, promise of the wall and allegiance to the second amendment. At one point The Donald even stopped his speech and walked off stage to find a woman who fainted in the crowd. He gave her a hug and thanked her for her support.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was only a matter of time, however, before some negative energy spilled inside. Fists began to fly in the upper row and security escorted out about twenty people, including one young woman dressed all black and wearing a burka. The scene, captured by NBC, was making its round on cable television. What they neglected though, was the turmoil escalating outside.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the rally was over, the protests outside had ramped up. They had tripled, nearly quadrupled in size. An old man was called a “nazi”. A blued-haired girl was called a “communist”. The words “sadist”, “racist, and “pig” were flying around and the Trump crowd’s go-to line was to tell the protestors to “get a job”, over and over again.&nbsp;<br><br>After all was said and done, left outside, where Haywood meets Flint street, stood a Vietnam vet holding a sign that read, “Muslims Matter”. He appeared far older than the college students and high schoolers left over in the road, who were relentlessly debating each other.&nbsp;<br><br>“I’ve stood on this corner for the past 20 years, at just about every presidential rally,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>He had been drafted when he was 22 to be part of the infantry at the end of the war. and he didn’t want his name printed.&nbsp;<br><br>“I don’t believe [politics] has gotten any worse or better,” he said. “All I know that it’s different. People don’t worry about being drafted anymore.” He then chimed in on the topic of racism. “No. I don’t believe so. Your generation didn’t invent racism or sexism. These things have been around forever, and so has politics. If anything is to change, y’all are the ones to do it.”&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center"><b>Can New Governor, Roy Cooper, Save North Carolina’s Education System&nbsp;<br></b>by: James Luke Barber&nbsp;<br><br>The implication of the governor’s race on North Carolina universities was settled on Monday, Dec. 5 when Governor Pat McCroy conceded to Democrat Roy Cooper. During the campaign season, Cooper ran on increasing teacher pay, expanding resources available to students, and making North Carolina a leader in education.&nbsp;<br><br>According to the National Education Association, North Carolina currently sits at 42nd in teacher pay and 51st in the percentage change in this area from 2013 to 2014. The NEA study was published in 2015. The results show that NC has been steadily improving in education, but the state is still far off from being an example for others to follow.&nbsp;<br><br>“There has been a bit of a budget crunch over the years,” says dance professor Emily Daughtridge of Appalachian State University. “There has been little in raises and more of a focus from the administration on assessments, reports and busy work in general, time which would be better spent on actual teaching.”&nbsp;<br><br>As part of the 2017 Fiscal Year State Budget, 84.5 million dollars have been set aside to give teachers a 1.5 percent bump in their salaries. Also included is 31 million dollars to encourage enrollment growth in the UNC System and a revision that repeals the cap which was previously set in place to discourage universities from using state funds to fundraise privately.&nbsp;<br><br>Fundraising, as shown by the repealing of this revision, has become an increasingly important tool to acquire additional funds previously supplied by the state. While university spending is as high as its been in recent years, it is still sputtering below the peak it reached before the 2008 financial collapse. All the while, student populations continue to grow in number, diversity and economic background. So universities must take it upon themselves to fill in this ever increasing gap between enrollment and funding.&nbsp;<br><br>“There is a chance for a conflict of interest to develop,” says ASU technology professor George Devine. “Companies like Nike, Adidas and others already make millions off of schools’ athletic programs. There is a chance this company-school relationship could spill over into academics, and a conflict between public and private interests could ensue.”&nbsp;<br><br>Recently, ASU completed its largest fundraising campaign to date, collecting over 203 million dollars, which exceeded its goal of 200 million. The breakdown: 107.6 million went towards operations and program support, 45.7 million goes toward scholarship support, 32.7 million goes toward facilities, 9.8 million for faculty/staff support and the remaining 7.7 million is unrestricted.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In total, there were 41,515 donations, over half of which were first-time donors. The 203 million raised is approximately half of the schools net worth, which clocks in at about 411 million dollars.&nbsp;<br><br>Upon completion of the fundraising campaign, Chancellor Sheri Everts releasing the following statement: “As we work diligently to keep tuition and fee increases in balance, private funding continues to be instrumental in providing our students, faculty and staff with the resources they need to succeed at the highest level,” she said.&nbsp;<br><br>Chancellor Everts was unavailable to comment on if any business interests or companies associated with certain foundations had played a major role in supplying the school with these funds. However, a large amount of funds do come from alumni who, generally, do not have as much to give as graduates from private institutions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;According to a study published by the Council to Aid Education, public schools are depending more and more on private funds. On list of the top 20 fundraising universities, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill came in at number 19, which raised around 250 million dollars. The top of the list included the likes of private institutions such as Stanford, Harvard and Yale, while Duke University rested in the middle with just 100 million more dollars in donations than Chapel Hill.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;“I think that the increased courting of private donors by public universities is deserving of public scrutiny,” said ASU reporter Sammy Hanf.&nbsp;<br><br>The argument that private donors are used to keep tuition and fees down is defeated by the fact that tuition was increased at ASU by 5 percent in 2014 (increases are capped at 5 percent by the state), a proposal that was meant to be implemented over a two year period. This was coupled alongside general fee increases of approximately 400 dollars for room, board, books and transportation. This proposal was approved by the UNC Board of Governors for the 2015-2016 academic year.&nbsp;<br><br>These price increases could also be due to the fact that the school was expecting a 2 percent reduction in state appropriations over this same time period.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;“I believe the school and the state should everything they can to keep the prices of public universities affordable,” says ASU student Dakota Manns. “If prices keep continuing to go up then that is going to leave more and more people out of the opportunity of going to college.”&nbsp;<br><br>ASU student Lauryn Hayes had a different opinion on tuition increases. “As long as the money is going towards improving academics and providing more resources for teachers, then I’m all for it. However, if it’s going towards further expanding the football program then I think that is a misuse of student money,” she said.<br><br>Despite the differences of opinion, many people involved in the university system remain hopeful about the future of education in the state, as Governor-elect Roy Cooper is the source of much of this optimism. However, he has an uphill battle to climb. The NC General Assembly remains under Republican control, with the senate being 15 to 34 red, and the house being 45 to 72 red. If Cooper is going to truly increase the funds provided to the UNC system then he is going to have to work with the same lawmakers who prioritized their focus on technical schools over liberal education.&nbsp;<br><br>Still, despite the stagnation of funds, ASU continues to remain an institution of affordable, quality education. According to the U.S. News and World Report Rankings, ASU is ranked 3rd amongst top, public regional universities in the South, and 10th when private schools are included. Graduation and admission rates also to continue to grow, and with a Democratic Governor, these findings should only continue to improve.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center"><b>A Conversation with Tammy Rogers of the SteelDrivers: Singer, Musician and Professor</b> by: James Luke Barber&nbsp;<br><br>One thread that runs through bands such as the SteelDrivers, Black Sabbath and Genesis is that they’ve all produced genre defining music that also set the stage for their lead singers to develop into successful solo artists. However, the burgeoning of such talent is not possible without the accompaniment of strong musicianship.&nbsp;<br><br>When Chris Stapleton left the SteelDrivers in 2010, the band moved forward with great uncertainty. It is rare for to lose such a talent and still retain the edge that makes a band prominent. It is even rarer, almost unprecedented to come back and win a Grammy. Fortunately, the scenario turned out to be a win-win for both of the groups’ latest release: the SteelDriver’s “Muscle Shoals Collection” and Stapleton’s solo effort “Traveler”.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>The Bluegrass outfit’s fiddle player, Tammy Rogers, knows a thing or two about going solo. In the 1990s, while living in Nashville, she produced a trio of solo work in which she sings and performs various instruments. Born in Nashevill, she moved to Irving, Texas as a child and back to East Tenessee upon graduating. One of her first major gigs was as a touring artist for country music singer Kieran Kane. In 2008 she helped form the SteelDrivers and her voice is featured alongside Chris Stapleton, and now Gary Nichols in their newer work.&nbsp;<br><br>The SteelDrivers are performing this Friday, Nov. 11 at the Schaefer Music Center at Appalachian State University. The show begins at 7:00 pm and is expected to sell-out.&nbsp;<br><br>JLB: What was so meaningful about Muscle Shoals that led the band to record there?<br>&nbsp;TR: There were many reasons, but the main one was because Gary Nichols grew up in that area of Alabama. There was a moment when we decided as artists to put the ball even more firmly in Gary’s court. He is too talented to just be someone who sings our old catalog. When he joined the band after Chris left, there was a need to further expand what we were doing. So, we gave him some creative control and said ‘let’s run with it’.&nbsp;<br><br>JLB: Jason Isbell plays slide guitar on “Here She Goes” and “Brother John”, which he also helped produced. How did the SteelDrivers, Jason Isbell connection develop?&nbsp;<br>TR: That’s another Gary Nichols story. Jason grew up in that part of Alabama and he and Gary met around the age of 14 or 15 and connected over their love of country music and bluegrass. They started to play together in different bars and joints. They were just a couple of guitar slingers.&nbsp;<br><br> JLB: Being someone who has lived and breathed country music for most of your life, how did it feel to finally win a Grammy?&nbsp;<br>TR: Well, we probably experienced every emotion possible: shock, obviously; joy, relief. After all of these years, finally getting there has been nothing short of amazing. We really believed in this music and thought it was a great, great album. However, when we were nominated we didn’t expect to win. We even told people it wouldn’t happen. So the surprise was definitely welcomed.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;JLB: Having won the most coveted award in the music industry, is there any temptation to rest on you laurels so to speak?&nbsp;<br>TR: We’re definitely not the type to rest. We always want to be pushing the boundaries and expanding our sound. But the Grammy does make things easier moving forward. 2016 has been our best year so far. Our show in Boone will be our 16th or 17th weekend in a row touring. There’s been a direct correlation in a rise in our popularity, the money’s been better, just everything seems to go a bit smoother.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;JLB: What were some of the challenges for the band moving forward after Chris Stapelton decided to embark on his solo career?<br><br>&nbsp;TR: Honestly, we didn’t see how we would be able to come back from that. Chris has a very distinctive Southern voice and it really defines the sound of our earlier recordings. But we got through it, and it was really crazy and rare to be able to keep going.&nbsp;<br><br>JLB: Was it more of a random occurrence finding Gary Nichols, or was there more of a concerted effort.<br>&nbsp; TR: The goal was not to try and find the same type of singer. Having an impersonator up there would most likely not have gone well. The band is very individualistic. We needed someone who could stand out, while also fitting in. But finding Gary was rather spontaneous. Our manager was sniffing around online, and stumbled on this raspy, soul singer and he called me late one night and said, “I think we found our guy.” I even called my husband Jeff King (who is also a musical vet in Nashville) and he happened to know him and had nothing but great things to say about him.&nbsp;<br><br>JLB: When was the point in your life when you picked up a fiddle, or violin, and had the realization that this is what you needed to do. TR: When I was real young, my Dad signed me up for the orchestra, and at first I resisted it. Then one day, as I opened the case, I began to fall in love with it. By the time I was 10 or 11, I was playing all the time. In my 20s I began working toward being a professional musician and I moved from Texas to East Tennessee. I was even thinking of moving to Boone at one point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>JLB: Appalachian State is know for many things, one of which is an outstanding music department. Do you have any advice for students entering into an uncertain industry? <br>TR: I tell my students at Belmont University this as well, just play as much as you absolutely can, any genre, any setting, be comfortable being uncomfortable and say yes to everything. Also, learn as much as you can, even if that lesson is, ‘I don’t want to do that again.’ Don’t worry so much about the hierarch of the music, wether this or that is better is not as important, open yourself up to possibility.&nbsp;<br><br>JLB: Are there any lessons that being a musician has taught you that are unique to the experience?&nbsp;<br>TR: In one respect it has taught me that there are other parts of the world that I have no control over. Naturally, I am more of a laid back person so you really have to kind of go with the rhythm of things. There are a lot of people who wake up in the mornings and go to a job they can’t stand. I am very lucky to be doing what I love. I’m definitely not in it for the money, and if you are then this profession is not for you. Just try to find something you enjoy. It doesn’t have to be in the arts. Practice, get good at it, and find a way to get paid to do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center"><b>The National Park System is Pulsing with Black Gold&nbsp;</b><br>by: James Luke Barber&nbsp;<br><br>In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant put the land that is now Yosemite National Park beyond value by designating it in the public’s trust. The park was the first of its kind, a land open to and owned by the citizens.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, the National Park System conserves about five percent of the country’s landmass. Out of 417 parks, 40 are open to drilling. In these parks, surface rights belong to the federal government. While rights to the resources beneath belong to private owners, many of whom have sold ownership of this land to oil and natural gas companies over the years.&nbsp;<br><br>The New River Gorge National River and Gauley River National Recreation Are are two of the smaller parks within the Service. These parks, connected by a river system in West Virginia, are not as widely known as the big nine—that being Yosemite, Yellowstone, The Grand Canyon, the Badlands, the Everglades, the Great Smoky Mountains, Grand Teton, Sequoia and Glacier National Park—it is, however, part of the nine where drilling has recently taken place, and in some cases still occurring.&nbsp;<br><br>“Fortunately, they didn’t find much.” said Claire Rodzilski, who is the acting chief of natural resources at the Gauley River Recreation Area.&nbsp;<br><br>The site, which encompasses hundreds of miles of untamed wilderness and powerful rapids, was the subject of the U.S. Geological Survey in 2001 that found that the land was rich with natural gas. An oil rig was soon erected, the land was drilled, they did their business and left. Yet, on their way out they didn’t bother capping the well, which is has been leaking out a nearly imperceptible gas.&nbsp;<br><br>“There are about 12 orphaned wells in all,” Rodzilski said “most were drilled before the park was founded. They’re not really obvious though. You would have to go out of your way to find them.”&nbsp;<br><br>Whether the gases come from oil wells, shale wells or natural gas wells, the conditions that produced them are the same: organic material, like ancient flora and fauna, is compressed by extreme heat and pressure for millions of years to form the crude mixture. Once a pocket of air cracks into this once impenetrable layer, it’s byproducts, or gases like CO2, methane, benzine, and propane, are released into the air.&nbsp;<br><br>Bob Swarthout, who has a doctorate in environmental chemistry at Appalachian State University, researches the impact of pollutants derived from organic compounds.&nbsp;<br><br>“These gases, while not high in toxicity, do lead to the formation of ozone downwind,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>Ozone is the chemical compound that makes up the part of the atmosphere that protects the Earth from ultraviolet light. At surface level, it can be troublesome. Over exposure, especially in children, the elderly and people in cities, can lead to respiratory problems like asthma.<br><br>&nbsp; “The effect that ozone has on our national parks though, is that it effects visibility. Someone standing on top of a mountain on a clear day may be able to see about twenty or thirty miles out. On a day where the air is thick with ozone, that visibility reduces to about a mile or two,” Swarthout said.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Oil and gas contractors must go through a series of regulations to acquire the drilling permits from the Department of the Interior—the federal agency of which the NPS is under. However, since the inception of the Trump administration, new regulations and drilling permits have been frozen.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;John Perez, the manager of the gas well program at the Gauley River, is one of the first people to have experienced the dramatic change in policies between the Obama and Trump administrations.<br><br>&nbsp;“It’s a big problem. In fact we were supposed have training this month for new regulations, but at the moment we’re in limbo,” he said.&nbsp;<br><br>While the gas wells at the New River and Gauley River parks are not likely to capped any time soon, their interactions with the oil and gas industry are not likely to see many new developments.&nbsp;<br><br>“We’re fortunate not to be around, or on top of, any potential fracking site,” Perez said.&nbsp;<br><br>Fracking is a much more imposing problem, not just for these split-estate parks, but for the service as a whole. One can find orphaned wells dotted around just about any park in the system, but in states where energy is produced in mass, drilling sites not even located within the park can pose serious risk.&nbsp;<br><br>In North and South Dakota, the Bakken Shale formation produces the largest amount of oil and natural gas in North America. In fact, so much natural gas is extracted that it has to be burned off and converted into CO2. The infrastructure to ship it to market is almost not existent, so it is wasted. It is so prevalent that the combined light emanating off of these rigs at night make North Dakota look like a bustling metropolis when viewed from space.&nbsp;<br><br>“Fracking has seen an exponential growth since it became common practice around the time the internet was invented,” said Bob Swarthout.&nbsp;<br><br>The key feature that allowed for its effective use is horizontal drilling. High pressured water, with a mixture of chemicals added to it, crack open the shale layer, and the drill bit follows, spiraling down until it changes direction at a 90 degree angle hundreds of feet below the surface.&nbsp;<br><br>So national parks on top of shale formations, like Big Cypress in South Florida, Big Thicket in East Texas, and—ironically enough—Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota, are susceptible to being drilled even when a fracking well is not on the actual property.<br><br>&nbsp; “If your neighbor wants a drill running through his backyard then there is really nothing you can do,” said Swarthout.&nbsp;<br><br>The problem though is that not everyone considers these parks as part of their backyard. Perhaps, the are too often viewed like a safety deposit, a last resort resource waiting too be tapped once less and less oil is capable of being discovered.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center" contenteditable="true"><b>Randy Johnson: The History and Guide to an Appalachian Icon&nbsp;<br></b>by: James Luke Barber&nbsp;<br><br>Randy Johnson is a literal trailblazer. Throughout a forty year career of conservation he has tracked through countless miles of forest with the intention of creating trails for others to enjoy.&nbsp;<br><br>He is a mountaineer, an explorer and a writer. However, the title he prefers, above all else, is that of a photojournalist.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Johnson has recently published an extensive work on North Carolina’s most popular scenic attraction. The book, entitled “Grandfather Mountain: The History and Guide to an Appalachian Icon” is complete with high resolution photographs and a chronological history of human interaction with the local environment. Five years of research, writing and hiking has gone into realizing Johnson’s goal of creating a work that “captures the voices of the high country.”&nbsp;<br><br>The fascination with Grandfather began when Johnson moved to North Carolina in 1977 from New Hampshire. Familiar with the Appalachians up North, he was impressed the by the immense size of the mountain upon seeing it for the first time.<br><br>&nbsp;He recalled, “It seemed like it was out of place, like it was scooped out of the Swiss Alps or the Rockies and placed amongst the rolling hills that surround it.”&nbsp;<br><br>The importance of Grandfathers preservation was immediately impressed in his mind and his work soon began. One of the first trails Johnson cleared was the Shanty Spring Trail. Its formation is based on path that early settlers, scientists and mountaineers, like Daniel Boone, hiked in order to access the mountain. Nowadays the path is relatively unknown. Johnson cleared it in the late 70s and it has since been reclaimed by the forest. Upon revisiting the area where the trail had been, he learned first-hand the resiliency Grandfather possess and the futility of human efforts to tame it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;“For someone who’d personally reclaimed the trail almost forty years earlier, it was a humbling experience of human transience,” Johnson says.&nbsp;<br><br>Throughout Grandfather’s history, this kind of experience with its ecology is not an uncommon one. Many efforts have been made to protect the mountain, but despite numerous failed attempts, Grandfather has endured.&nbsp;<br><br>One man who possessed the same passion for conservation as Randy Johnson was President Teddy Roosevelt. During his time in office, from 1901 to 1909, he attempted to pass legislation that protected the land that he called “the heaviest and most beautiful hardwood forests on the continent.”<br><br>&nbsp; Roosevelt viewed the area as only a US President could. In a report from the secretary of agriculture, his administration outlined the importance of the mountain’s well-being, “The rivers which originate in the Southern Appalachians flow into or along the edge of every state from Ohio to the Gulf and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. Along their courses are agricultural, water-power and navigational interests whose preservation is essential to the well-being of the nation.”<br><br>&nbsp; If history had been any different, then Grandfather Mountain may have been one of the many preservations that Roosevelt adopted into the National Park Service during his time in office. However, no legislation was passed and the land remained privately owned. Monetary interests took over and in 1906 the lumber industry rolled into town.&nbsp;<br><br>Its operations were massive. Entire forests were clear cut and shipped out aboard the newly laid railroads. Mountain sides were shaved down and only stumps were left as reminders of the forests that had been undisturbed for thousands of years. The Globe, the area of forests surrounding the base of Grandfather, was decimated and the area that is now known at the Pisgah National Forest looked as if a bomb had gone off.&nbsp;<br><br>Despite the industry’s efforts, Grandfather remained mostly preserved, but not due to the work of any business or political figure. No. The mountain’s enormity and rocky terrain protected large sections of virgin forest from deforestation. The logistics of cutting and shipping the timber out of certain sites was impossible and any persistent effort would endanger the lives of the lumbermen.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;What remained on Grandfather was enough pristine forests to preserve what Johnson calls, “The most ecologically significant mountain in the Appalachians.”&nbsp;<br><br>By the 1940s, the lumber industry had moved out and reforestation efforts had been well under way. The environment had recovered better than most mountains that had been clear cut and Grandfather entered into an age of tourism. Now people would come to be a part of Grandfather’s natural beauty, not to take advantage of it.&nbsp;<br><br>The new economic and social environment in the region led the way for Randy Johnson, and other conservationists like him, to make the mountains more accessible for everyone.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Randy has been instrumental in designing and constructing sections of the Mountain To Sea Trail as well as the Tanawha Trail (Grandfather’s Cherokee name). He was even an advisor to the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway along parts of North Carolina and was close Hugh Morton, who was the former owner of Grandfather Mountain.&nbsp;<br><br>Randy has written for many travel and outdoor lifestyle publications and has won the NC Press Association Award.&nbsp;<br><br>On his thoughts as to why he decided to write a book about Grandfather Mountain, he said<br><br>&nbsp; “I love Grandfather and I have a great respect for mountain culture and its people. I’ve been here a long time I wanted to do something to honor those who have made me a part of their community. This book is my way of giving back.”&nbsp;</p>
